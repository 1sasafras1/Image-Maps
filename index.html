		<h1>Welcome to the FTDA</h1>
		here at the FTDA (fake teen driving assosiation.) we are dedicated to the saftey of teens while driving on the road. 
		to help with this I created a image map located on the top of the site. if you want to know what the sign is just click on it.

		<map name="driving">
		 <area shape="circle" coords="436,147, 81" href="#" alt="circle" onclick="circle('you clicked on a circle / stop sign in europe I think.')">
		 <area shape="rect" coords="412,247,477,384" href="#" alt="rect" onclick="alert('You clicked on a rectangle/directional arrow sign')">
		 <area shape="poly" coords=" 86,176,97,192,600,450" href="#" alt="triangle" onclick="alert('you clicked on a triangle/ yield sign. :D')">
		</map>
